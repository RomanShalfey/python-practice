# Python Practice 🐍

This repository is my **sandbox** for learning Python.

It contains small educational projects and experiments that I do to reinforce syntax, algorithms, and working with libraries.

## 📂 Repository structure
Each project is in a separate folder and contains:
- source code (`.py` files),
- separate `README.md` with a description,
- (if possible) tests.

## 🚀 List of projects
- [8ball](./8ball) — console version of Magic 8-ball with predictions.
- [factorial_calculator](./factorial_calculator) — factorial calculator.
- [package_delivery_cal](./package_delivery_cal) — calculation of delivery cost depending on weight and type.
- (new projects will be added)

## 🧪 What I'm practicing
- Python basics (variables, loops, conditions),
- functions and modules,
- simple algorithms,
- working with input/output,
- unit testing (pytest),
- project design on GitHub.

## 📌 Note
This is a learning repository: many of the projects are simple, but they are designed in a way that allows you to follow my progress and approach to the code.
