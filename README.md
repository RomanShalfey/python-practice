# Python Practice 🐍

This repository is my **sandbox** for learning Python.

It contains small educational projects and experiments that I do to reinforce syntax, algorithms, and working with libraries.

## 📂 Repository structure
Each project is in a separate folder and contains:
- source code (`.py` files),
- separate `README.md` with a description,
- (if possible) tests.
